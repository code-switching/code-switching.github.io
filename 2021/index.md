<h2 class="subtitle" id="call-for-papers"><a href="#call-for-papers" class="text-primary-red">First Call for Papers</a></h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

<p>
Multilingual speakers will often mix languages when they communicate with other multilingual speakers in what is usually known as code-switching (CSW). 
CSW is typically present on the intersentential, intrasentential and even morphological levels. 
CSW presents serious challenges for language technologies such as Machine Translation (MT), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), language generation (LG), information retrieval (IR) and extraction (IE), and semantic processing. Traditional techniques trained for one language quickly break down when there is input mixed in from another. 
Recent work has shown that even powerful multilingual models, such as multilingual BERT, yield subpar performance on CSW data (cf. Aguilar and Solorio, 2020).
</p>

<p>
Considering the ubiquitous nature of CSW in informal text communication such as newsgroups, tweets, blogs, and other social media, and the number of multilingual speakers worldwide that use these platforms, addressing the challenge of processing CSW data continues to be of great practical value. 
This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in technology for mixed language data, in either spoken or written form, and increase community awareness of the different efforts developed to date in this space.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle" class="text-primary-red">Topics of Interest</h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

The workshop will invite contributions from researchers working in NLP and speech approaches for the analysis and processing of mixed-language data. Topics of relevance to the workshop will include the following: 
1. Development of linguistic resources to support research on code-switched data; 
2. NLP approaches for any of language identification/named entity recognition/sentiment analysis/machine translation/language generation in code-switched data; 
3. NLP techniques for the syntactic analysis of code-switched data; 
4. Domain/dialect/genre adaptation techniques applied to code-switched data processing; 
5. Language modeling approaches to code-switched data processing; 
6. Crowdsourcing approaches for the annotation of code-switched data; 
7. Position papers discussing the challenges of code-switched data to NLP techniques; 
8. Methods for improving ASR in code switched data; 
9. Survey papers of NLP research for code-switched data; 
10. Sociolinguistic and/or sociopragmatic aspects of code-switching.

<hr class="custom-line">

- Workshop submission deadline (long, short and special track): March 15th, 2021

<h2 class="subtitle" id="shared-task"><a href="#shared-task" class="text-primary-red">Shared Tasks on Machine Translation in Code-Switching Settings</a></h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

<p>
In the past few years we have organized a series of shared tasks focusing primarily on enabling technology for code-switching, including language identification, part of speech tagging and named entity recognition. This year we are organizing a series of shared tasks involving machine translation for code-switching settings in multiple language combinations and directions. 
</p>


<h5 class="subtitle" id="shared-task-1"><a href="#shared-task-1" class="text-primary-red">Task 1. Supervised Setting: MT for English → Hinglish</a></h5>
<p>
In this task we provide gold standard data to train and evaluate MT models to take English as input and generate Hinglish data.
</p> 

<h5 class="subtitle" id="shared-task-2"><a href="#shared-task-2" class="text-primary-red">Task 2. Unsupervised Setting: MT for multiple language combinations</a></h5>
<p>
We provide raw data with no gold label translations. Participants are challenged to work on systems that can generate high quality translations in the pairs shown below. More language directions may be added soon:
</p>

- Spanish-English → English
- Spanish-English → Spanish
- English → Spanish-English
- Spanish → Spanish-English
- Spanish → English
- English → Spanish
- Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic → English
- Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic → Spanish

<h5 class="subtitle" id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" class="text-primary-red">Evaluation</a></h5>
The leaderboard will rank systems based on BLUE scores. We also plan to do a smaller, human evaluation that will be presented at the workshop.

<h2 class="subtitle" id="submission"><a href="#submission" class="text-primary-red">Submission</a></h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

- Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, unpublished work in the topic areas listed above. Long papers can contain up to eight pages with unlimited number of pages for references, while short papers can include up to four pages of content and unltimited pages for references.
- All submissions must be in PDF format and must comply with the official NAACL 2021 style guidelines: [https://2021.naacl.org/calls/papers/#submission-types--requirements](https://2021.naacl.org/calls/papers/#submission-types--requirements)

<h5 class="subtitle" id="reiew-process"><a href="#review-process" class="text-primary-red">The Review Process</a></h5>
<p>
The reviewing process will not be blind and papers can include the authors’ names and affiliations. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.
</p>

<h5 class="subtitle" id="multiple-submission-policy"><a href="#multiple-submission-policy" class="text-primary-red">Multiple Submission Policy</a></h5>
<p>
Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications are acceptable, but authors must indicate this information at submission time. If accepted, authors must notify the organizers before the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented at the workshop or elsewhere.
