<h2 class="subtitle" id="call-for-papers"><a href="#call-for-papers" class="text-primary-red">First Call for Papers</a></h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

<p>
Multilingual speakers will often mix languages when they communicate with other multilingual speakers in what is usually known as code-switching (CSW). 
CSW is typically present on the intersentential, intrasentential and even morphological levels. 
CSW presents serious challenges for language technologies such as Machine Translation (MT), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), language generation (LG), information retrieval (IR) and extraction (IE), and semantic processing. Traditional techniques trained for one language quickly break down when there is input mixed in from another. 
Recent work has shown that even powerful multilingual models, such as multilingual BERT, yield subpar performance on CSW data (cf. Aguilar and Solorio, 2020).
</p>

<p>
Considering the ubiquitous nature of CSW in informal text communication such as newsgroups, tweets, blogs, and other social media, and the number of multilingual speakers worldwide that use these platforms, addressing the challenge of processing CSW data continues to be of great practical value. 
This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in technology for mixed language data, in either spoken or written form, and increase community awareness of the different efforts developed to date in this space.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle" class="text-primary-red">Topics of Interest</h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

The workshop will invite contributions from researchers working in NLP and speech approaches for the analysis and processing of mixed-language data. Topics of relevance to the workshop will include the following: 
1. Development of linguistic resources to support research on code-switched data; 
2. NLP approaches for any of language identification/named entity recognition/sentiment analysis/machine translation/language generation in code-switched data; 
3. NLP techniques for the syntactic analysis of code-switched data; 
4. Domain/dialect/genre adaptation techniques applied to code-switched data processing; 
5. Language modeling approaches to code-switched data processing; 
6. Crowdsourcing approaches for the annotation of code-switched data; 
7. Position papers discussing the challenges of code-switched data to NLP techniques; 
8. Methods for improving ASR in code switched data; 
9. Survey papers of NLP research for code-switched data; 
10. Sociolinguistic and/or sociopragmatic aspects of code-switching.

<h2 class="subtitle" id="shared-task"><a href="#shared-task" class="text-primary-red">Shared Tasks on Machine Translation in Code-Switching Settings</a></h2>
<hr class="custom-line">

<p>
In the past few years we have organized a series of shared tasks focusing primarily on enabling technology for code-switching, including language identification, part of speech tagging and named entity recognition. This year we are organizing a series of shared tasks involving machine translation for code-switching settings in multiple language combinations and directions. 
</p>


<h5 class="subtitle" id="shared-task-1"><a href="#shared-task-1" class="text-primary-red">Task 1. Supervised Setting: MT for English → Hinglish</a></h5>
<p>
In this task we provide gold standard data to train and evaluate MT models to take English as input and generate Hinglish data.
</p> 

<h5 class="subtitle" id="shared-task-2"><a href="#shared-task-2" class="text-primary-red">Task 2. Unsupervised Setting: MT for multiple language combinations</a></h5>
<p>
We provide raw data with no gold label translations. Participants are challenged to work on systems that can generate high quality translations in the pairs shown below. More language directions may be added soon:
</p>

- Spanish-English → English
- Spanish-English → Spanish
- English → Spanish-English
- English → Spanish
- Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic → English
- Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic → Spanish
- English → Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic

For example:
- **\[Spanish-English → English\]**: I’m expecting dos camonietas llenas de rosas This weekend. → I’m expecting two trucks full of roses This weekend.
- **\[Spanish-English → Spanish\]**: Es viernes y el outfit lo sabe → Es viernes y el atuendo lo sabe
- **\[English → Spanish\]**: My goal is to move to my own apartment next year → Mi objetivo es mudarme a mi propio apartamento el próximo año
- **\[Spanish → English\]**: A mi manera o pa la calle!! → My way or the highway!!

<h5 class="subtitle" id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" class="text-primary-red">Evaluation</a></h5>
We will use [Linguistic Code-Switching Evaluation Benchmark](https://ritual.uh.edu/lince/home). The leaderboard will rank systems based on BLUE scores. We also plan to do a smaller, human evaluation that will be presented at the workshop. 

<h5 class="subtitle" id="datasets"><a href="#datasets" class="text-primary-red">Datasets</a></h5>
To access the data sets go here: [Linguistic Code-Switching Evaluation Benchmark](https://ritual.uh.edu/lince/datasets)

**[Update (03/29/2021)]:**  The usernames are removed from the datasets. Please download the newest version of datasets from Lince.
<br>
**[Update (04/19/2021)]:**  The test sets for <u>ENG-HINGLISH</u>, <u>ENG-SPA</u>, and <u>SPANGLISH-ENG</u> have been released! You can downlaod them from Lince now!
<br>
**[Update (04/20/2021)]:**  The test sets for <u>ENG-SPANGLISH</u>, <u>MSAEA-ENG</u>, and <u>ENG-MSAEA</u> have been released!
<br>
**[Update (04/24/2021)]**:  We will **NOT** evaluate <u>ENG-SPA</u> and <u>MSAEA-SPA</u>. Please just submit your results for above 5 tasks. Also, please **<font color=red>NOTE</font>** that you need to make your results public before the deadline!
<br>
**[Update (04/26/2021)]**:  The submission deadline is now postponed to **<font color=red>Apr 26th, 2021</font>**!
<br>
**[Update (04/29/2021)]**:  All the datasets for the CALCS 2021 shared tasks have been released. Please check them [here](https://ritual.uh.edu/lince/datasets).
