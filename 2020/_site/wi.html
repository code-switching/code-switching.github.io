<h1 id="workshop-information">Workshop Information</h1>

<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in solving the problem and increase community awareness of the possible viable solutions to reduce the complexity of the phenomenon. The workshop invites contributions from researchers working in NLP approaches for the analysis and processing of mixed-language data especially with a focus on intrasentential code-switching. Topics of relevance to the workshop will include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development of linguistic resources to support research on code-switched data</li>
  <li>NLP approaches for language identification in code-switched data</li>
  <li>NLP approaches for named entity recognition in code-switched data</li>
  <li>NLP techniques for the syntactic analysis of code-switched data</li>
  <li>NLP techniques for higher level tasks on code-switched data, such as Q&amp;A, language understanding, grounding</li>
  <li>Domain/dialect/genre adaptation techniques applied to code-switched data processing</li>
  <li>Language modeling approaches to code-switched data processing</li>
  <li>Crowdsourcing approaches for the annotation of code-switched data</li>
  <li>Machine translation approaches for code-switched data</li>
  <li>Multimodal approaches to processing code switched data</li>
  <li>Application of low resource processing paradigms to code switch processing</li>
  <li>Position papers discussing the challenges of code-switched data to NLP techniques</li>
  <li>Methods for improving ASR in code switched data</li>
  <li>Survey papers of NLP research for code-switched data</li>
  <li>Sociolinguistic aspects of code-switching</li>
  <li>Sociopragmatic aspects of code-switching</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="theme">Theme</h1>

<p>This year we propose a theme for the workshop around resources and evaluation metrics and frameworks. The goal of the theme is to disseminate more broadly the data sets that are available for the research community, and to engage the community in a discussion about adopting best practices and common frameworks to enable a comprehensive evaluation of technology for code-switched data. We welcome submissions responsive to the theme, in addition to the topics listed above.</p>
