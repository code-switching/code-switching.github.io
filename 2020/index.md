What is Code Switching?
=======================

- Code-switching (CS) is the phenomenon by which multilingual speakers switch back and forth between their common languages in written or spoken communication. 
- CS is typically present on the intersentential, intrasentential (mixing of words from multiple languages in the same utterance) and even morphological (mixing of morphemes) levels. 
- CS presents serious challenges for language technologies such as Parsing, Machine Translation (MT), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), information retrieval (IR) and extraction (IE), and semantic processing. 
- Traditional techniques trained for one language quickly break down when there is input mixed in from another language. 
- Even for problems that are considered solved for specific domains and languages, such as language identification, or part of speech tagging, performance degrades at a rate proportional to the amount and level of the mixed-language present.
